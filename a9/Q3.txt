This is faster than sRead because every time there is a read the IO Controller performs the read and the CPU
performs different tasks at the same time (Here the task is putting threads onto a queue).
This is more efficient as it does not waste much CPU time.

As the number of blocks increase, the efficiency of tRead decreases compared to aRead. This is because with multiple 
threads, there are multiple calls to uthread_block() and uthread_join(). This decreases the efficiency of the entire 
process.
